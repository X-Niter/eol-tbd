## [1.2.0]
- AssetMover was added then removed.
- 7DTM mod that is added now has my DTM-Integration mod added to the pack which is used for making 7DTM to work better with other mods.
- Quests were added thanks to (SKYB0R9)
- Swapped Original Baubles with my Baubles-LTS for more up to date code.
- JEI is swapped with HEI
- trevorcraft-ea3 removed and might return in the future with a more configurable fork down the road
- A decent amount of game improvment and QOL mods. (Sorry I lost the list of which ones were added)
- Realistic Item Drops are now Auto Pickup-able, no longer do you need to manually click each item you're trying to pick up
- Any armor should now allow protection against the burning sun, the better the armor the better the protection
- Only blindness and weakness is given if you're under the sun naked, the nausia effect was too much motion sickness
- Open Modular Turrets were added due to the lack of static defense blocks
- AE2 Wireless Terminal mod swapped with my fork which fixes the Creative menu crashing and item Translation keys.
- GTNHu added to the pack, not with the intention of being overly grindy, but to sink folks into a realism persona of survival.
- Major change on wild resource spawning to emphasize the dependency on `Ex Nihilo`
- Gregicality Multiblocks added to allow higher gains ability with lower tiers by utilizing multi block functionality.
- Progression is purposly left up to the player, as this is survival, it's up to you to figure it out, but optionialy you may use the quests as a pointer in direction or just for the loot!
- AE2 Facades are now hidden in the HEI/JEI as it was a waste of 3/4/5 pages, the quests will have a step if you need to learn what these are.
- Refined storage is not going to be included, instead we have AE2 with NO channels to lesson AE2's complexity along with AE2 addons to make AE2 more appeasing and fun.
- Seed Market should be gone, on purpose to motivate the need for exploration both on the desserted earth and other planets.
- Removed Portal gun (Sorry y'all this seems just a bit too much sci-fi like)
- Lootr will no longer use it's own texture for containers, containers will keep there defaults but lootr will handle there loot.
